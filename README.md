**This Project made by Mate Kavelashvili for [Picnic](https://getpicnic.app/#/) I used NodeJS for server environment and its dependencies to create connection to MySQL**
## Getting Started
1. `npm init -y` - to initialize node.
2. `npm i express mysql nodemon` - initialize mysql,express and nodemon
3. Please import test.sql in your Database Software (I used MySQL)
4. Happy Testing ðŸš€

# ðŸ›‘DATABASE IS CONNECTED TO LOCALHOST!ðŸ›‘


### Installed Dependencies 
to view all depenencies please open package.json in BackEnd folder.
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MySQL](https://getpicnic.app/#/)
- [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

### Making Project step by step was very interesting

1. First of all I installed all dependencies (You can find it on package.json)

2. after that I conveted csv data to sql and imported it in MySQL Database

3. When I wanted to create connection I used mysql dependency

4. now when database is ready and application is connected we need to extract data using simple SQL command

5. after all of this, I realised that server environment isnot ready. "It's Showtime!"

6. Ok, everything is ready now I use axios to fetch data from API in REACT.

7. Simple answer on main question is that amount of people who clicked first on Snapchat is 5423
